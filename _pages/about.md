I did my graduate studies (M.A.Sc, 2010 and Ph.D., 2015) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Canada. Following several postdoctoral trainings at the University of Windsor (2015), Duke University (2015 - 2018), and Unity Health Toronto (2018-2021), I joined McMaster Oncology in 2021.
It was during my postdoctoral training at Duke, I started to learn to work with medical data. 
I continue to learn in my current position from all the resources that I can find and from the work that I perform. My research, learning, and teaching focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Healthcare with an emphasis on advanced analytics related to Breast Cancer.
