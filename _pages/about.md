I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Oncology, Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Canada](https://oncology.healthsci.mcmaster.ca/). 
I am the inaugural [BRIGHT Run](https://brightrun.ca/) Breast Cancer Learning Health System Chair at McMaster University. 

I am a Scientist at the [Escarpment Cancer Research Institute](https://ecri.mcmaster.ca/), Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster University, Canada. I am an Affiliate Scientist at the CentRE for dAta science and digiTal hEalth [(CREATE)](https://createhealth.ai/), Hamilton Health Sciences. I am a Faculty Member in the [eHealth](https://ehealth.mcmaster.ca/) program at McMaster.

I hold associate memberships with the [School of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/msbe/) and the [Department of Computing and Software](https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/cas/), Faculty of Engineering, McMaster University. 

My research, learning, and teaching focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Healthcare with an emphasis on advanced analytics related to Breast Cancer. While leading my own research projects, I collaborate with my colleagues and fellow researchers in a variety of topics that relate to advances in healthcare research propelled by AI.

Summary of my training so far:
======
I am trained in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (B. E., 2006) from the Indian Institute of Engineering, Science, and Technology, (IIEST), Shibpore, India. I worked for almost 2.5 years as a SAP consultant in PWC, India. 
I did my graduate studies (M.A.Sc, 2010 and Ph.D., 2015) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Canada. Following several postdoctoral trainings at the University of Windsor (2015), Duke University (2015 - 2018), and Unity Health Toronto (2018-2021), I joined McMaster Oncology in 2021.
It was during my postdoctoral training at Duke, I started to learn to work with medical data. 
I continue to learn in my current position from all the resources that I can find and from the work that I perform.
